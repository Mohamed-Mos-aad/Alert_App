        description: "The application is consuming a significant amount of memory, which could impact performance and user experience. High memory usage can be caused by memory leaks, large data sets, or inefficient algorithms. Regularly monitor your applicationâ€™s memory consumption and utilize tools such as React's Profiler to identify and optimize memory-intensive components. Consider implementing pagination, lazy loading, and memoization to reduce memory footprint.",
